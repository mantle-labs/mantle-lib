/* 
 * Mantle API
 *
 * Most endpoints require authentication with an API key.  You must first authenticate with your account by logging in your account on app.mantle.services. Then, you will need to navigate to the \"My API Key\" page in the Administration section. You might need to have the user administrator of your organization generate you an API Key first.  You must then use this API Key in all your requests with the following header:  [ x-api-key: API_KEY ].
